# Hi there, I'm Eliza Kishan 👋

**Undergraduate Research Trainee** | Przybyl Lab, Research Institute of the McGill University Health Center

I'm a bioinformatics researcher passionate about leveraging computational methods to advance our understanding of genomic variation. Currently, I'm investigating the use of methylation data for calling copy number variations (CNVs) and characterizing algorithmic performance—bridging the gap between molecular biology and machine learning.

🔬 **What I Do:**
- Research at the intersection of bioinformatics, statistics, and machine learning
- Develop and evaluate computational approaches for genomic analysis
- Work with large-scale biological datasets using R, Python, C++, and Java

🌱 **Currently Exploring:**
- Wet lab research techniques to complement my computational work
- Bioinformatics challenges via Rosalind
- Software engineering best practices for reproducible research

💼 **Open to Opportunities:**
I'm seeking new opportunities starting May 2026 in bioinformatics, computational biology, drug discovery, or machine learning research roles with translational impact.

## 🔬 Research Interests

My current work focuses on leveraging methylation data for copy number variation detection, but I'm broadly interested in computational approaches that bridge genomics and translational medicine. Areas I'm particularly excited about include:

- **Drug Discovery** - Using computational methods and genomic insights to identify therapeutic targets and optimize drug candidates
- **Tissue Engineering & Synthesis** - Applying genomics to understand and guide tissue development and regeneration
- **In-Silico Tissue Modeling** - Building computational models to simulate tissue behavior and predict responses to interventions
- **Machine Learning in Genomics** - Developing robust algorithms for analyzing complex biological datasets

I'm eager to explore opportunities that combine computational biology, machine learning, and applications with direct clinical or therapeutic impact.
